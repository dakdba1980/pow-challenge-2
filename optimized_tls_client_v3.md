The error occurs because the `ValueProxy` object from multiprocessing doesn't have a `get_lock()` method. Let me fix this by properly handling the shared counter:The key fixes I made to resolve the `AttributeError: 'ValueProxy' object has no attribute 'get_lock'` error:

## Main Changes:

1. **Fixed multiprocessing stats counter**: 
   - Removed the `get_lock()` call from the global worker function
   - The `multiprocessing.Value` already handles synchronization internally

2. **Fixed threading stats counter**:
   - Used a dictionary with separate `value` and `lock` keys
   - Properly synchronized access with `with stats_counter['lock']:`

3. **Separated monitoring functions**:
   - `_monitor_and_collect_result_mp` for multiprocessing
   - Updated threading result handling to use `append()` instead of `put()`

4. **Improved error handling**:
   - Better separation between multiprocessing and threading approaches
   - Cleaner fallback mechanism

## Key Points:

- **Multiprocessing**: Uses `multiprocessing.Value('i', 0)` which is thread-safe by default
- **Threading**: Uses a dictionary with explicit lock for thread-safe counter updates
- **No more pickling issues**: The global worker function doesn't reference class methods
- **Robust fallback**: If multiprocessing fails, threading will work reliably

The code should now work without the `ValueProxy` error and efficiently solve the level 6 proof-of-work challenge using all available CPU cores.

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python optimized_tls_client_v3.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python optimized_tls_client_v3.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```
