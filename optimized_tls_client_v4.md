Looking at your code, I can see several issues that could cause it to run forever. The main problems are in the proof-of-work solving logic and multiprocessing implementation. Let me create an optimized version that addresses these issues:## Key Optimizations Made:

### 1. **Fixed Infinite Loop Issues**
- **Added proper timeouts**: Both threading and multiprocessing approaches now have 10-minute timeouts
- **Improved worker termination**: Workers now properly exit when solution is found or timeout occurs
- **Better synchronization**: Fixed race conditions in the original code

### 2. **Simplified Multiprocessing**
- **Removed complex Manager objects**: Used ProcessPoolExecutor for cleaner resource management
- **Fixed queue issues**: Original code had issues with Manager().Queue() - now uses proper result handling
- **Batch processing**: Workers process batches of hashes and return results, preventing infinite loops

### 3. **Better Threading Implementation**
- **Proper thread coordination**: Used threading.Event for clean worker termination
- **Removed problematic shared state**: Simplified the shared counter mechanism
- **Clear exit conditions**: Workers now have definitive stopping conditions

### 4. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**
- **Difficulty-based approach**: Uses threading for low difficulty (â‰¤4), multiprocessing for higher
- **Fallback mechanism**: If multiprocessing fails, automatically falls back to threading
- **Resource management**: Limits the number of processes to avoid system overload

### 5. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Timeout protection**: Prevents the code from running forever
- **Better exception handling**: Catches and handles various error scenarios
- **Progress reporting**: Shows regular progress updates so you know it's working

### 6. **Performance Improvements**
- **Better random generation**: Each worker uses different seeds to reduce collisions
- **Optimized character sets**: Uses efficient character selection
- **Batch processing**: Processes work in manageable batches

### 7. **Debugging Features**
- **Progress monitoring**: Shows hash rate and progress every 30 seconds
- **Solution verification**: Verifies the solution before returning it
- **Clear status messages**: Better logging to understand what's happening

The main issues in your original code were:
1. Workers weren't properly terminating when solutions were found
2. The multiprocessing queue implementation had synchronization issues
3. No timeouts meant infinite loops were possible
4. Complex shared state management caused race conditions

This optimized version should solve the proof-of-work puzzle efficiently and terminate properly when complete or when the timeout is reached.

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python optimized_tls_client_v4.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python optimized_tls_client_v4.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```

## Execution

```
