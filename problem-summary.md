Thanks for confirming. If it's **still taking a long time**, let's troubleshoot deeper.

## ⚠️ Problem Summary

You're solving a TLS Proof-of-Work challenge with **SHA1 difficulty = 9**, which means you're looking for a SHA1 hash starting with **9 hex zeros**: `000000000`.

This is **very hard** — on average:

```
1 in 16⁹ = 1 in ~4.3 billion hashes
```

If your CPU can compute **1 million SHA1 hashes per second**, it would still take **\~4300 seconds (\~70 minutes) on one core**.

---

## ✅ Solutions

### ✅ 1. **Test If You’re Really Using All Cores**

Add this line before you spawn workers:

```python
print("CPU Count:", os.cpu_count())
```

Then add inside each worker:

```python
print(f"Worker {multiprocessing.current_process().name} started")
```

If you don’t see 4–8 processes running, it’s not parallelized properly (or you're on Windows and didn't use `if __name__ == "__main__"` properly).

---

### ✅ 2. **Verify You’re Getting Reasonable Hash Rate**

Add benchmarking to see how many hashes per second each process gets:

```python
start = time.time()
...
if attempts % 100_000 == 0:
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    rate = attempts / elapsed if elapsed > 0 else 0
    print(f"[{multiprocessing.current_process().name}] Rate: {rate:.2f} H/s")
```

Expected:

| Hardware          | SHA1 H/s (1 core) | Time to solve (parallel) |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Raspberry Pi      | \~50k H/s         | \~90 mins (1 core)       |
| Intel i5 (laptop) | \~300k H/s        | \~15 mins (4 cores)      |
| Intel i7/i9       | \~1M H/s/core     | \~2–5 mins (8 cores)     |
| Modern AMD        | 2–3M H/s total    | \~30 sec–1 min           |

---

### ✅ 3. **Use Better Randomness Strategy**

Try fixed-length suffix (e.g., 10–12 chars), but you can improve search with **partial brute-force of the end bits** (e.g., fix 4 chars, only mutate last 4).

Also try **pre-seeding** randomness with process-specific state to reduce collision risk.

---

### ✅ 4. **Try CPU-Optimized Hashing**

Use the **OpenSSL `SHA1`** directly via Python bindings:

```python
from Crypto.Hash import SHA1

def compute_sha1(s):
    return SHA1.new(data=s.encode()).hexdigest()
```

Install with:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

This is **much faster than hashlib** on many systems (especially with OpenSSL hardware acceleration).

---

### ✅ 5. **Run a Controlled Benchmark Test (No TLS)**

Try this standalone test to check how fast your system can find a SHA1 with 9 leading zeros:

```python
import hashlib, secrets, string, time

chars = ''.join(c for c in string.printable if c not in '\n\r\t ')
authdata = "testdata"
target = '000000000'
attempts = 0
start = time.time()

while True:
    suffix = ''.join(secrets.choice(chars) for _ in range(10))
    result = hashlib.sha1((authdata + suffix).encode()).hexdigest()
    attempts += 1
    if attempts % 100_000 == 0:
        elapsed = time.time() - start
        rate = attempts / elapsed
        print(f"Attempts: {attempts}, Rate: {rate:.2f} H/s")
    if result.startswith(target):
        print(f"Found: {suffix}, SHA1: {result}, Attempts: {attempts}, Time: {time.time() - start:.2f}s")
        break
```

This tells you:

* How many hashes/second your system is doing
* How long it takes to get lucky

---

## 💡 Realistic Options

If you're still over 10 minutes:

* Switch to **PyPy**: 2×–5× speedup
* Try running on a different machine (cloud VM or another PC)
* Reduce difficulty to 8 for test purposes and validate PoW logic

---

## 🚀 Want Me To...

* Convert this to a **native C** or **Rust** program for ultra-speed?
* Create a **mock TLS server** for testing your PoW logic without server wait?
* Help you submit via GPU? (if allowed by test)
