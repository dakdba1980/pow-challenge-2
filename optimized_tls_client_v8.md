You're right - the current approach is far too slow for difficulty 9. The issue is that you're trying to brute force 16^9 possibilities (over 68 billion combinations), which is computationally infeasible with the current method.

Let me create a much more efficient proof-of-work solver that uses smarter strategies:The key improvements in this version:

## Smart Strategies Instead of Brute Force:

1. **Pattern-Based Search**: Tests common patterns like "test", "pass", "key", etc. with variations
2. **Systematic Search**: Uses intelligent enumeration starting from different points for each worker
3. **Random Search**: High-quality random generation focusing on common lengths

## Optimizations:

1. **Smaller Batch Sizes**: 500K instead of 2M for faster iteration and feedback
2. **Multiple Strategies**: Each worker uses a different approach (systematic, pattern, random)
3. **Adaptive Behavior**: Increases batch size if taking too long
4. **Reasonable Worker Count**: Uses CPU count × 2 instead of × 3
5. **Shorter Timeouts**: 2 minutes per round instead of 1 minute

## Why This Should Be Much Faster:

- **Pattern-based search** often finds solutions quickly for common cases
- **Systematic search** covers the space more intelligently
- **Random search** provides good coverage with probability-based length selection
- **Parallel execution** with different strategies increases chances of quick success

The ETA calculation in the original code was misleading because it assumed pure brute force. This version should find solutions much faster by being smarter about which candidates to try first.

Try this version - it should perform significantly better for difficulty 9 challenges!

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python optimized_tls_client_v8.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python optimized_tls_client_v8.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```
