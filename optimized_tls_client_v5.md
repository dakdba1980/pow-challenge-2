For difficulty 9 (9 leading zeros), we need a much more aggressive optimization approach. Here's a heavily optimized version specifically designed for high-difficulty proof-of-work:## Key Optimizations for Difficulty 9:

### 1. **Multi-Strategy Approach**
- **Systematic Search**: Enumerates combinations starting from different points per worker
- **Random Search**: High-entropy random generation with optimized seeding
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines both approaches for maximum coverage

### 2. **Ultra-Optimized Hash Operations**
- **Byte-level operations**: Works with bytes instead of strings where possible
- **Pre-computed values**: Avoids repeated calculations
- **Fast hash verification**: Uses byte comparison for target checking

### 3. **Massive Parallelization**
- **Up to 32 workers**: Uses more processes for high difficulty
- **Large batch sizes**: 10M hashes per batch to reduce overhead
- **Non-overlapping search spaces**: Workers start from different points

### 4. **Advanced Progress Tracking**
- **Real-time statistics**: Shows hash rate, progress, and time estimates
- **Round-based reporting**: Clear progress indicators per batch
- **ETA calculations**: Estimates remaining time based on current rate

### 5. **Memory and Performance Optimizations**
- **Optimized character set**: Pre-encoded for faster access
- **Efficient random generation**: Pre-generated random values
- **Reduced function call overhead**: Minimized repeated operations

### 6. **Difficulty-Specific Tuning**
- **1-hour timeout**: Appropriate for difficulty 9
- **Smart length selection**: Varies suffix lengths based on worker strategy
- **Adaptive batch sizing**: Larger batches for high difficulty

### 7. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- **Graceful timeouts**: Proper cleanup after timeout
- **Worker fault tolerance**: Continues if individual workers fail
- **Solution verification**: Double-checks results before returning

### Expected Performance:
- **Difficulty 9**: ~68 billion attempts needed on average
- **Target rate**: 1-10 million hashes/second depending on your hardware
- **Estimated time**: 10 minutes to 2 hours depending on luck and hardware

### Hardware Recommendations:
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (8+ cores recommended)
- **RAM**: At least 8GB for large batch processing
- **Python**: Use Python 3.8+ for best performance

This version should handle difficulty 9 much more efficiently than the original code. The combination of systematic enumeration, random search, and massive parallelization gives you the best chance of finding a solution within reasonable time.
