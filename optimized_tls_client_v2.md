The error occurs because the `SSLSocket` object cannot be pickled when using multiprocessing. Here's the fix - we need to separate the proof-of-work calculation from the main client class:The key changes I made to fix the pickling error:

1. **Moved the worker function outside the class**: The `pow_worker_function` is now a global function that can be pickled by multiprocessing.

2. **Added a fallback to threading**: If multiprocessing fails (due to pickling issues or other problems), the code automatically falls back to using threading.

3. **Split the solving logic**: Created separate methods for multiprocessing and threading approaches.

4. **Fixed the threading stats counter**: The threading version now uses a simpler approach for the stats counter.

5. **Better error handling**: The code now gracefully handles the transition from multiprocessing to threading if needed.

## Key Features:

- **Automatic fallback**: If multiprocessing fails, it automatically switches to threading
- **No pickling of class objects**: The worker function is now standalone and doesn't reference the class
- **Robust error handling**: Better handling of edge cases
- **Same performance benefits**: Still uses all CPU cores when possible

This should resolve the "cannot pickle 'SSLSocket' object" error while maintaining the performance optimizations. The multiprocessing approach will work in most cases, and if it fails, the threading fallback ensures the code still runs efficiently.

## Usage:

```bash
# Basic usage
python optimized_tls_client_v2.py --cert client.crt --key client.key

# With custom host/port
python optimized_tls_client_v2.py --host 18.202.148.130 --port 8083 --cert client.crt --key client.key
```

## Execution

```python optimized_tls_client_v2.py --cert client.crt --key client.key
